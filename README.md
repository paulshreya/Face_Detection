### Face Recognition from Video

## Overview
This project is a Python-based face recognition system designed to detect faces in a video stream and compare them with a preloaded dataset of facial features associated with different personalities. It utilizes popular libraries such as OpenCV and dlib for face detection and recognition.

## Features
1. Face detection in real-time video streams.
2. Comparison of detected faces with a preloaded dataset of facial features.
3. Recognition and identification of personalities based on facial features.

## Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. OpenCV
3. dlib
4. Other dependencies (install using pip install -r requirements.txt)
